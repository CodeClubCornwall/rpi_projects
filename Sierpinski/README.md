These are the notes I created for a walk-through to making a Sierpinski gasket
in Python using the turtle module. I did this with a year 6
[CodeClub](www.codeclub.org.uk) who had completed lessons 1-4 of the Term 4
syllabus and so all the comments assume that level of knowledge.

The code is not written to be given out but rather as a guide for the teacher.

I managed to get through everything except part 5 (choosing random corners) in
a little over an hour.
